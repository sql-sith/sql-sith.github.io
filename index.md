# Chris's Christmas Gift and Charity List

I'm putting my Christmas list on GitHub so I can say things about each item. Also, I can't help it - everything goes on GitHub. Most of these are too expensive for Secret Santa. Beyond that, I don't know what anybody's budget is for Christmas, so feel free to team up on gifts if you want.

## Charity

Even though I like getting presents, you know I don't need anything, and I'm always happy when I see Christmas or my birthday become a reason to care for people who DO need things. Here are some ideas:

**Compassion**

> Sponsoring a child through [Compassion](https://www.compassion.com/) costs $43 a month, and the impact is far-reaching. About 80% of your support provides essentials like education, nutrition, medical care, spiritual guidance, child protection, and community programs. These services benefit not only the child you sponsor but also other children in the community. The remaining 20% supports administration and the onboarding of new sponsors.
>
> Many organizations offer child sponsorship, but Margie and I have a long history with Compassion, and we’ve seen firsthand the difference it makes.

**World Vision**

> Water and chickens and goats, oh my! [World Vision](https://www.worldvision.org/) is always active in finding and helping people in need wherever they are. They have many ways to give, and use each to serve others with essentials like clean drinking water, emergency food products, refugee assistance, and goats and chickens.

**Vision to Learn**

> Pulitzer Prize–winning New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently recognized [*Vision To Learn*](https://visiontolearn.org/news/nick-kristof-names-vision-to-learn-as-2025-holiday-impact-prize-honoree/) as part of his annual Holiday Impact Prize. The nonprofit brings free eye exams and glasses directly to schools in low-income communities, where millions of children struggle to learn simply because they cannot see the board. Research shows that providing glasses can improve academic performance even more than additional tutoring or study time. Teachers often report that once students receive glasses, classroom behavior and engagement improve dramatically. The program costs about $150 per child, but donations of any amount help ensure that every child has the clear vision they need to succeed.

> Kristoff designated a total of three charities as Holiday Impact Prize honorees. You can read about all three of them in the [press release](https://kristofimpact.org/2025-kristof-holiday-impact-prize-press-release/).

**Blood:Water**

> [Blood:Water](https://bloodwater.org/) believes that "the Water & HIV/AIDS crises [in Africa] are inextricably linked. They have a strong focus on Africa, HIV/AIDS, and waterborne illnesses.

## OpenGarage Universal Wifi Garage Door Opener

I run a very secure OS on my phone, which is great, but it breaks some apps. This device would let me run a local server to control our garage (and later lights, cameras, TV, etc.) without relying on Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. That sounds fun.

- Version 2.3+ (for Chamberlain, Liftmaster, Craftsman)
- Including the USB adapter would be nice
- Currently $46, marked down from $56

## Baseball hats

I have a ton of ballcaps, I know. But I lost one of my only solid-color ones in California. I miss it as an option - I keep wanting solid-color hats without logos.

- Preferences:
  - Curved bills, not flat ones
  - Strap and buckle in back, not snaps
  - Black, gray, red, blue, green
  - Vintage/washed, not rock-solid color like my dad would wear :)
  - Darker/muted hues. They don't need to be visible after sunset.

## Conference room speaker and mic

Right now, when we record my Cyber Defense Team's meetings, we have to use my laptop's mic, which makes it hard to hear other people on the recordings. [This one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW31YBD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_btm?ie=UTF8&th=1) is highly rated by customers and has a Black Friday price of $47.99 right now.

## Socks

I usually buy Adidas socks, but I can flex. My shoe size is 13, but it's OK to get socks that are one size smaller.

- No-show ankle socks: too short
- Ankle socks (over the ankle bone): nice
- Quarter-fit socks: niiiice
- Crew socks: too big

## Undershirts

Undershirts are great for layers. I hardly ever wear them because mine are ancient. The size should be XL.

- Here's some [normal ones](https://www.amazon.com/Hanes-Essentials-Crewneck-Available-Fashion-t-shirts/dp/B00W9MU7UK/ref=sxin_17_sx_hve_deal?content-id=amzn1.sym.79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6%3Aamzn1.sym.79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6&crid=UK4L9LO0ETKA&cv_ct_cx=men%27s%2Bundershirts&keywords=men%27s%2Bundershirts&pd_rd_i=B00W9MU7UK&pd_rd_r=e01baa5d-efd4-4165-abaf-62c657fa6105&pd_rd_w=88G6y&pd_rd_wg=1xmmJ&pf_rd_p=79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6&pf_rd_r=M07D9HWXC8CW58PQ382Q&qid=1763946668&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=men%27s%2Bundershirts%2Caps%2C333&sr=1-3-9036c2af-0d6a-4007-a635-d50f3d0f5a3b&th=1&psc=1)
- These cost more, but they're [bamboo cotton](https://www.amazon.com/BAMBOO-COOL-Undershirt-Moisture-Wicking-T-Shirts/dp/B0BXFHW91M/ref=sxin_17_sx_hve_deal?content-id=amzn1.sym.79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6%3Aamzn1.sym.79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6&crid=UK4L9LO0ETKA&cv_ct_cx=men%27s%2Bundershirts&keywords=men%27s%2Bundershirts&pd_rd_i=B0BXFHW91M&pd_rd_r=e01baa5d-efd4-4165-abaf-62c657fa6105&pd_rd_w=88G6y&pd_rd_wg=1xmmJ&pf_rd_p=79b3b15c-b438-4704-a2b9-361704a22de6&pf_rd_r=M07D9HWXC8CW58PQ382Q&qid=1763946668&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=men%27s%2Bundershirts%2Caps%2C333&sr=1-4-9036c2af-0d6a-4007-a635-d50f3d0f5a3b&th=1&psc=1). Hmm...

## Watchband

My watchband is falling apart. I have a Samsung Watch6 Classic, size 43mm (some are 47mm, so look out for that). I trust you to pick out a good one. My watch is silver around the outside. I'll change the watch face to something that goes with the watchband you buy, or you can pick one out for me. :)
